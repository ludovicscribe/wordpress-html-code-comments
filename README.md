# HTML code in comments

This very light WordPress plugin allows to put HTML code in comments. The code inside `<code>` and `<pre>` tags will be automatically encoded.

## How to use

Just put the `html-code-comments` folder in the plugin directory of your WordPress installation (`/wp-content/plugins/`) and activate the extension in your admin panel.
